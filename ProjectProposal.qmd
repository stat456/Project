## Project Overview
Intro to Bayesian statistics has a course project worth 40% of the final grade. The project will be completed individually on a dataset of the student's choosing. The project should follow the five steps of a Bayesian analysis from DBDA:

  1. Identify the data relevant to the research question(s).
  2. Define a descriptive model for the relevant data.
  3. Specify a prior distribution on the parameters.
  4. Use Bayesian inference to re-allocate probability across parameter values.
  5. Check that the posterior predictions mimic the data with reasonable accuracy.
  
  
## Project Proposal (5 points)

For the project proposal, describe a dataset and associated research question that you will explore. Create at least one figure from that dataset to help motivate your research question.
